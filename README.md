A from-scratch chess engine :)

My plan is to be motivated to work on this for a while.
Firstly, I want to create the game engine, but in a very optimized way for the future engine. I plan on using bitmaps and stuff.
Secondly, create an engine, more precisely a new type of chess engine, more to be said later.
